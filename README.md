# Mohamed Elsherbiny — Profile site (generated)

This folder contains a minimal static site scaffold to convert your LinkedIn profile into a GitHub Pages site.

What I added

- `index.html` — one-page template with sections for About, Experience, Education, Skills, Projects, Contact.
- `assets/css/style.css` — minimal styling.
- `assets/images/` — place project or profile images here.

Next steps

1. Paste your LinkedIn text into the sections in `index.html`, or grant permission for me to fetch the public profile and I will populate the file automatically.
2. Replace the contact email in the Contact section.
3. Add images to `assets/images/` and reference them from `index.html`.
4. Commit and push to GitHub. To publish with GitHub Pages, set the repository Pages source to `gh-pages` branch or `main`/`/` root depending on your preference.

If you want, I can now fetch the public profile at:

https://www.linkedin.com/in/mohamed-elsherbiny-emam/

and populate the sections automatically — confirm and I will attempt a fetch (note: some sites block automated fetches; if that happens I'll ask you to paste the profile content instead).
